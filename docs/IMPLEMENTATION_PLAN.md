# Implementation Plan

Living plan for building out `carve`. [CARVE_DESIGN.md](../CARVE_DESIGN.md) is the
architecture (the *what* and *why*); this document tracks *status* and the
*ordered remaining work* (the *when* and *in what order*). It supersedes the
month-by-month sketch in CARVE_DESIGN.md §11. Update it as milestones land; keep
it honest.

Bottom line: **Layer A produces a correct-shaped CDB with header coverage and
incremental refresh.** scan-deps is wired into `refresh`; unchanged actions
reuse cached headers; editing a header re-scans only its owning actions;
`written_at` and the persisted `HeaderIndex` are in place. Remaining M1
hardening: the missing-generated-header guard and parallel scanning (`--jobs`).

## Milestones (dependency-ordered)

### M1 — Wire scan-deps into `refresh` (the keystone)
Realizes incremental refresh and header coverage; everything downstream assumes it.

- ✅ For each compile action, call `scan_deps::ScanDependencies(argv, execroot)`; store results in `ActionRecord.headers`. (#9)
- ✅ Reuse on unchanged actions: `MergeRecords` keeps cached headers, and `refresh` re-scans only added/changed actions (`HasMatchingRecord`). (#10)
- ✅ Set `ActionRecord.written_at` via an injected clock (deterministic in tests) — unblocks `prune`. (#11)
- ✅ Build and persist the `HeaderIndex` (header → owning `action_key`s, canonical owner = lex-min) next to the sidecar so an edited header maps to the action(s) to re-scan (design §4.4–§4.5).
- ✅ Header-staleness invalidation: on refresh, an action whose cached header (or source) changed on disk (mtime past `written_at`) is re-scanned even though its command is unchanged, via `FindReusableRecord` + a `rescanned` set passed to `MergeRecords`. One-second granularity.
- ⬜ Missing generated headers: cache only when no headers are missing (design §4.2); surface a count.
- ⬜ Parallelize scanning across actions (`--jobs`, default hardware concurrency).
- ✅ **Platform/optionality decision — resolved (option b).** `scan_deps` is gated linux+macos and injected into `refresh` as a `HeaderScanner`, so the core CDB still builds everywhere and header-scanning is the enhancement; the gate propagates to the `carve` binary and e2e test.

Acceptance: `carve refresh` on this repo populates `headers`; editing a header invalidates only owning actions; refresh stays idempotent; unit + e2e tests cover header population, reuse, and missing-header caching.

### M2 — Complete the de-Bazel quirk inventory (CARVE_DESIGN §4.3)
Independent of M1; can run in parallel. One golden test per quirk (design §9.2).

- Execroot / absolute-path canonicalization (also the precondition for cross-host determinism and clean clangd paths).
- Apple `wrapped_clang` + `__BAZEL_XCODE_*`; NVCC→clang; MSVC `/showIncludes`; ccache symlink; Windows command-line length; `//external` symlink/execroot; `parse_headers`/`layering_check`/`compiler_param_file` action filtering.

Acceptance: golden test per quirk; platform-specific ones skipped where the toolchain is absent.

### M3 — Differential harness + clangd validation
Correctness gate before building Layer B/C on top.

- Run `carve` vs Hedron over a corpus (this repo + a couple of OSS Bazel repos); diff CDBs; document every meaningful difference (design §8, §9.4).
- Open the produced CDB in clangd against a real target; confirm navigation/diagnostics/background indexing work.

Acceptance: a committed diff report with differences explained; clangd verified working on carve itself.

### M4 — Layer B: `cc_carve` rule
`bazel build //:compile_commands` as the CDB entry point (design §4.6).

- Resolve the nested-bazel concern up front (running aquery inside a build action vs a `bazel run`/genrule shape).

Acceptance: `bazel build //:compile_commands` emits the CDB; integration test over a synthetic workspace.

### M5 — Layer C: aspect + shards
Per-action, individually-cacheable shards for huge repos (design §4.7); implements `aggregate`/`shard`.

Acceptance: aspect emits shards; `carve aggregate` merges; editing one source rebuilds only its shard.

### M6 — 0.1 release + distribution
`.bcr/` metadata, release automation, prebuilt binaries for common platforms (design §7); decide Windows in-or-out.

Acceptance: a bzlmod consumer can `bazel_dep(name = "carve")` and get a working CDB; tagged release.

## Cross-cutting / parallelizable
- `prune` subcommand (GC by `written_at`; needs M1's timestamps).
- `aggregate` / `shard` subcommands (land with M5).
- Parallel scan-deps (`--jobs`) — fold into M1.
- Property tests: idempotency (have a dogfood check; codify), cross-host determinism (needs M2 canonicalization).
- Keep [docs/test-plan.md](test-plan.md) at zero open debts.
- Latency reality: Layers A/B re-run `bazel aquery` every refresh (design §3.1); sub-second incrementality on huge repos is a Layer C (M5) property — don't over-promise before then.

## Sequencing rationale
M1 first — it converts the working skeleton into the actual product (incrementality + headers). M2 runs alongside (independent). M3 validates correctness before B/C are layered on. M4 → M5 (B before C, per the design's layering). Release (M6) last. Riskiest dependency (LLVM linkage) and toolchain are already done.
